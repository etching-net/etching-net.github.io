# DIGITAL ARTIFACTS INDEX

### What is this?

**Etching.net** is a volunteer-curated [list of Bitcoin digital artifacts](#bitcoin-artifacts-by-ordinal) that exemplify longstanding cultural value. Anyone can contribute a record to the index.

A [project to inscribe important information](https://github.com/users/etching-net/projects/1) on the Bitcoin network base layer is also organized here. You can learn more about the underlying technology at the [Ordinals website](https://ordinals.com).


### Why though?

The mission of etching.net is to preserve humanity's hard-won knowledge on the blockchain, like a time-capsule, in order to reduce the potential damage to civilization in the case of a catastrophic event.

These records can also serve as a rich library for learning anywhere in the world today, as well as in the far, uncertain future.


### How is it different from other NFTs?

Young memes reflected on nonfungible tokens (NFTs) often swing wildly in their popularity and price. By embracing time-tested memes – ancient ideas that have consistently captivated the minds of the day's youth and their ancestors – etching.net points to a long-term value proposition for the NFT space that places quality above quantity.

The vision is to start small and simple, promote steady contributions through organic growth, and carefully consider iterative improvements along the way.


### Who contributes?

You. Yes, you! This effort would be impossibly time-consuming and expensive for an individual, but it's great fun to chip away at as part of a global community.

Here are three ways you can help right now:

1. [**INDEX**](https://github.com/etching-net/etching-net.github.io/edit/main/README.md) – Add the ordinal of an existing digital artifact to be included in the list.  
   Fields: ART, HISTORY, HOW-TO, RELIGION, SCIENCE  
   Media: TEXT, IMAGE, AUDIO, VIDEO, OTHER

2. [**INSCRIBE**](https://github.com/users/etching-net/projects/1) – Suggest an inscription,  
   review the content of a proposal in progress, or  
   inscribe a new digital artifact yourself.

3. [**SUPPORT**](https://getmonero.org) – Fund new inscriptions
